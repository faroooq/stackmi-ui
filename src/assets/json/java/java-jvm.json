The JVM doesn't understand Java code directly, that's why you compile your <code>*.java</code>&nbsp;files to obtain&nbsp;<code>*.class</code>&nbsp;files that contain the bytecodes understandable by the JVM.</p>\n<p>JVM control execution of every Java program. It enables features such as automated exception handling, Garbage-collected heap and soon.</p>",
