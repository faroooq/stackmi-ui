But it is not a pure object-oriented language because it supports primitive data types like int, char etc.</p>\n<p>Java is a platform-independent language because it has a runtime environment i.e JRE and API.</p>\n<p>Java language source code is compiled into byte code or machine-independent code. This byte code we run on JVM (Java Virtual Machine).</p>\n<p>The syntax in Java is almost same as like C/C++. But java does not support low-level programming functions like pointers. Java source code is written in the form of Classes and objects.</p>\n<p>As of 2022, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, especially in case of client-server web applications.</p>",

Java history was started with the&nbsp;<strong>Green Team</strong>. The Green Team started a project to develop a language for digital devices such as television. But it works best for internet programming. After some time Java technology was joined by Netscape.</p>\n<p>The objective to create Java Programming Language was it should be \"Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic\".</p>\n<p>Initially, Java was called&nbsp;<strong>\"Greentalk\"</strong>&nbsp;by James Gosling and at that time the file extension was&nbsp;<strong>.gt</strong>.</p>\n<p>Later on Oak was developed as a part of the Green Team project. Oak is a symbol for strength and Oak is also a national tree in many countries like the USA, Romania etc.</p>\n<p>Oak was renamed as Java in 1995 because Oak was already a trademark by Oak Technologies. Before selecting the Java word the team suggested many names like&nbsp;<strong>dynamic</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>revolutionary</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Silk</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>jolt</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>DNA</strong>, etc.</p>\n<p><em>Java is an island in Indonesia</em>, here the first coffee was produced or we call Java coffee. Java coffee is a type of espresso bean. James gosling chose this name while having coffee near his office.</p>\n<p>The word JAVA does not have an acronym. It is just a name.</p>\n<p>In 1995 Java was one of the best product by the Time magazine.</p>",
