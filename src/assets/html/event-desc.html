    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Known as one of the most simple, versatile and effective languages; Javascript is used
        to extend and enhance the functionality of your websites. It uses a range of on screen visual effects for
        processing and calculating data on web pages with ease. It also has the ability to use third party scripts to
        add many handy features to make your website look and function uniquely. Above all, Javascript is a dynamic
        language and is the foundation of nearly all the interactive front end programming.
